            Jakarta covers 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi), the smallest among any
            Indonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers 6,392
            km2 (2,468 sq mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces of
            West Java and Banten.[52] The Greater Jakarta area includes three
            bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor
            Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang
            and South Tangerang).
          </p>

          <p>
            Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of
            the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is
            strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of
            Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[53]
            and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are
            hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the
            southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the
            area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2 (255 sq mi) of
            land area and 6,977 km2 (2,694 sq mi) of sea area.[54] The Thousand
            Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located
            in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from −2 to 91
            m (−7 to 299 ft) with an average elevation of 8 m (26 ft) above sea
            level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the
            city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur
            around the area.[55] Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are
            Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke, Maja,
            Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter
            River and Grogol River.[56][57] They flow from the Puncak highlands
            to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards
            the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western
            and eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season
            rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone
            to flooding.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) each
            year, and up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in the northern coastal areas. After
            a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is
            under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat
            from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and
            retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll
            road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[58] In
            January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in
            Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) tunnel from Ciliwung River to
            Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city.[59] Nowadays, a 1.2 km
            (0.75 mi), with capacity 60 m3 (2,100 cu ft) per second, underground
            water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is
            being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[60] In 2023,
            the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking
            up to 12 inches (30 cm) annually.[61]

            Environmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the
            extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the
            government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many
            recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories
            around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in
            a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road
            lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a
            groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally.[62]
            This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo
            has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for
            water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or
            limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like
            Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue.[63]
            The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable
            for drinking water.[64]

            Jakarta faces significant air pollution, particularly during the dry
            season from August to December. Dry air during this period allows
            pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended
            periods, contributing to poor air quality.[65][66]

          <h2>Climate</h2>
          <p>
            Jakarta experiences a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: Am) as
            classified by the system. The city's wet season spans most of the
            year, from October to May. The dry season lasts from June to
            September, with each of these months receiving less than 100
            millimetres (3.9 in) of rainfall on average. Situated in the western
            part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and
            February, averaging 299.7 millimetres (11.8 in) per month, while the
            driest month is August, with an average rainfall of 43.2 millimetres
            (1.7 in).[67]

            Every year faces recurring issues, such as floods and thunderstorms.
            A cyclonic vortex leads to moisture convergence over a large area,
            including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex causes a
            mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost
            perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these
            predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography in
            southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection
            that causes floods in Jakarta.[68]

            Average temperatures are very high with moderate rainfall. During
            the day, the temperature usually hovers around 32 °C (89.6 °F) but
            drops to about 24 °C (75.2 °F) in the evening. These are average
            temperatures, and some days can be hotter. It's advisable to dress
            appropriately to handle the heat. January is the rainiest month,
            with over 300 millimetres (11.8 in) of precipitation, whereas August
            is the driest, with around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) of rainfall. The
            average temperature in the coldest month (February) is 27 °C (80.6
            °F), and in the warmest month (October), it is 28 °C (82.4 °F). Sea
            temperatures range from 26.5 °C (79.7 °F) in August to 29.5 °C (85.1
            °F) in March, April, November, and December.[69][70] Record low
            temperatures in Jakarta recorded 18.9 °C (66.0 °F), while the
            highest record reached 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).[71]
