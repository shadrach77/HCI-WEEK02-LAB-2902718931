    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Precolonial Era</h2>

    <p>
      The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of
      prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[24] The
      area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese
      kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in
      Indonesia.[25] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated
      settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably
      written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village,
      Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara
      undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of
      the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[26]
      Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the
      Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to
      the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime
      empire. According to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1225,
      Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled
      Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda).[27] The source
      says the port of Sunda was strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from
      Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and
      their houses were built on wooden piles.[28] The harbour area became known
      as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮨᮜᮕ) and by the 14th century, it was an
      important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.

    <p>
      The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in
      1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.[29] The Sunda Kingdom
      made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a
      port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of the Demak Sultanate
      from central Java.[20] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military
      commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the
      Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[20] and became a fiefdom
      of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading
      centre.

    <p>
      Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate,
      Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an English East India Company (EIC)
      voyage led by Sir James Lancaster arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten,
      where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the
      centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[30]
      Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English
      merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build
      houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[29]

    <h2>Colonial Era</h2>

    <p>
      When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his
      soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies,
      however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival
      of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced
      them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and
      they renamed the city Batavia in 1619.[citation needed]
    </p>

    <p>
      Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially
      Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created
      burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to
      restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000
      Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the
      following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city
      walls.[31] At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and
      Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following
      decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported
      cotton, batik and clothing worn by Arab communities.[32]
    </p>

    <p>
      The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870
      forced residents to move away from the port. The Koningsplein, now Merdeka
      Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in
      1913,[33] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential
      area.[31] By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[34]
      including 37,067 Europeans.[35] The city was expanded in 1935 through the
      annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.[36]
    </p>

    <p>
      On 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the
      city was named Jakarta (Jakarta Special City (ジャカルタ特別市, Jakaruta
      tokubetsu-shi), under the special status that was assigned to the city).
      After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until
      full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed
      Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.

    <h2>Independence</h2>

    <p>
      After World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on
      17 August 1945,[37] and the government of Jakarta City was changed into
      the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the
      Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian republicans withdrew from
      Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.
    </p>

    <p>
      After securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national
      capital in 1950.[31] With Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games,
      Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated
      large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist
      architecture.[38] Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major
      boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National
      Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended
      to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of
      an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed,
      precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000
      people, including some ethnic Chinese.[39] The event marked the beginning
      of Suharto's New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the
      end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last
      mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno
      Sosroatmodjo as governor.

    <p>
      In 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (Daerah Khusus
      Ibukota), with a status equivalent to that of a province separated from
      West Java.[40] Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional
      governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the
      capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces.[41]
      Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he
      rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, and built hospitals
      and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new
      development projects — some for the benefit of the Suharto family,[42]—
      and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began
      control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[43]
      Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the
      face of Jakarta.[44] The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
      putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political
      manoeuvring.

      After three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane.
      Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University
      by security forces. Four days of riots and violence in 1998 ensued that
      killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings,
      forcing Suharto to resign.[45] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese
      Indonesians.[46] In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal
      point of democratic change in Indonesia.[47] Jemaah Islamiyah-connected
      bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[31]
      with another in 2009.[48] In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever
      election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation
      program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously,
      governors were elected by the city's legislative body.[49]

      During the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move
      Indonesia's capital to Nusantara after 17 August 2024,[50] but this has
      not occurred due to delays.[51]
    </p>

    <p>
      Between 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with
      scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi
      claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of Islamic State.
