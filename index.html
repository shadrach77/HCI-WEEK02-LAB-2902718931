            Jakarta[b] (/dʒəˈkɑːrtə/ ⓘ; Indonesian pronunciation: [dʒaˈkarta] ⓘ,
            Betawi: Jakartè), officially the Specific Region of Jakarta[c]
            (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Jakarta; DKJ) and formerly known as
            Batavia until 1949, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia and
            an autonomous region at the provincial level. Lying on the northwest
            coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the
            largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic
            capital of ASEAN. The Specific Region has a status equivalent to
            that of a province and is bordered by the province of West Java to
            the south and east and Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the
            Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung
            to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area is ASEAN's second largest
            economy after Singapore. In 2023, the city's GDP PPP was estimated
            at US$724.010 billion.

            Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of
            Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq
            mi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its
            metropolitan area covers 7,076.31 km2 (2,732.18 sq mi), which
            includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South
            Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 32.6
            million as of 2022, making it the largest urban area in Indonesia
            and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks
            first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index.
            Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its
            ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to
            other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the
            Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous
            cultures.

          <p>
            Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in
            Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa,
            the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At
            one time, it was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when
            it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West
            Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province
            with special capital region distinction. As a province, its
            government consists of five administrative cities and one
            administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and the ASEAN
            secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of
            Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of
            numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are
            located in the city. Jakarta, as Indonesia’s largest Muslim-majority
            city, is known for its tradition of religious tolerance and
            pluralism. The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia,
            stands as a symbol of the city’s commitment to interfaith
            harmony.[12][13]
          </p>

          <p>
            Jakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological
            breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and
            flooding due to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is
            relative, not absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17
            cm (6.7 inches) annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively
            safe. This has made the northern part of the city more prone to
            flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In
            response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo
            announced plans to move the capital from Jakarta to the planned city
            of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of
            Borneo. The MPR approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian
            government is not abandoning Jakarta after announcing plans to move
            the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend
            US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to build Nusantara, to
            save the city in the next decade.[14]
