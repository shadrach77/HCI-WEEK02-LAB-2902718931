    <h1>Jakarta</h1>

    <p>
      Jakarta[b] (/dʒəˈkɑːrtə/ ⓘ; Indonesian pronunciation: [dʒaˈkarta] ⓘ,
      Betawi: Jakartè), officially the Specific Region of Jakarta[c]
      (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Jakarta; DKJ) and formerly known as Batavia
      until 1949, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia and an autonomous
      region at the provincial level. Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the
      world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in
      Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. The Specific
      Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by
      the province of West Java to the south and east and Banten to the west.
      Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime
      border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area is ASEAN's
      second largest economy after Singapore. In 2023, the city's GDP PPP was
      estimated at US$724.010 billion.

      Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia.
      Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi) and thus has
      the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers
      7,076.31 km2 (2,732.18 sq mi), which includes the satellite cities of
      Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated
      population of 32.6 million as of 2022, making it the largest urban area in
      Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks
      first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index.
      Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to
      offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of
      the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian
      archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

      Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast
      Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became
      an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the
      de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia.
      Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its
      official status was changed to a province with special capital region
      distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative
      cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and
      the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of
      Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of
      numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located
      in the city. Jakarta, as Indonesia’s largest Muslim-majority city, is
      known for its tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism. The Istiqlal
      Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia, stands as a symbol of the city’s
      commitment to interfaith harmony.[12][13]

      Jakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological
      breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding due
      to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is relative, not
      absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches)
      annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively safe. This has made
      the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the
      fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in
      August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced plans to move the capital
      from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East
      Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The MPR approved the move on 18
      January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after
      announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister
      said, pledging to spend US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to
      build Nusantara, to save the city in the next decade.[14]
